#Assignment 1

1. What is indentation error? Why indentation is important? Give one simple example?

2. Correct the following code and write the comment where you made the correction?

  ```python
  class_started = bool(input("Hey friend, is class started?: [0-False/1-True]"))

  if class_started:
      print("Since class started...")
      print("Lets concentrate")
  else:
      print("Since class is not started...")
      print("let's revise")    
  ```

  **HINT:** Refer your data type conversion class

3. Use if else condition to verify that dataype of `input()` method in python is always string.

4. Take 3 variables and assign integer values to them. Find the largest variable, by only using the if and else conditions.


5. What would be the solution?
    1. True
    2. False

    ```python
    a = 6
    b = 10
    print( not ( not a == 10 or not b == 10) )
    ```
    
6. Find the answer as well as find out the reason behind the result? -
    - case 1:
        ```python
        A = 5.0
        B = 10/2
        print(A is B)
        ```
    - case 2:
        ```python
        A = 5.0
        B = int(10/2)
        print(A is B)
        ```
    - case 3:
        ```python
        A = 5.0
        B = float(10/2)
        print(A is B)
        ```

"""#Try to understand the following examples and answer the question based on it -
Arithmatic Operators

Operation	Meaning
+	addition
-	subtraction
*	multiplication
/	true division
//	integer division
%	the modulo operator
Here +, -, *, / are regular arithmatic operators. Lets look at the // and % operators

Usecase or examples -

var_a = 5
var_b = 25
integer_division = var_b // var_a
print(f"integer division: {var_b}/{var_a}={integer_division}")
OUTPUT: integer division: 25/5=5

var_a = 3
var_b = 25
integer_division = var_b // var_a
print(f"integer division: {var_b}/{var_a}={integer_division}")
OUTPUT: integer division: 25/3=8

var_a = 5
var_b = 25
remainder = var_b % var_a
print(f"remainder: {var_b}/{var_a} is {remainder}")
OUTPUT: remainder: 25/5 is 0

var_a = 3
var_b = 25
remainder = var_b % var_a
print(f"remainder: {var_b}/{var_a} is {remainder}")
OUTPUT: remainder: 25/3 is 1

"""#Answer below questions on the above theory -
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number. You should print out a message to the user, either “That number is divisible by either 3 or 5”, or “That number is not divisible by either 3 or 5”. Be sure to consider the data type of the input you are taking in from the user. Use a single if/else block to solve this problem.

Take user input for length and width. Then calculate the area of rectangle. Also print as per length and width whether its a square of rectangle.

Take two variable radius_1 and radius_2 and calculate the area of circle_1 and circle_2. Also print which circle has large area. If area is equal then print area is equal.

Check whether a year is leap year or not. Use nested if...else to solve this problem. A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.
